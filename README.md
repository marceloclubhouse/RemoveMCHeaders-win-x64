# Remove MC Headers (Windows Edition)
### A simple desktop app that removes Mail Chimp data from HTML files

If you've ever tried sending an exported Mail Chimp HTML file through a 3rd-party mail service, you might have noticed that your email sometimes contains unwanted text such as:

- \*|MC:SUBJECT|*
- \*|IF:MC_PREVIEW_TEXT|\*
- \*|MC_PREVIEW_TEXT|*

This app removes those headers automatically with an easy to use interface that takes less than a second to run.

## Usage

1. Click on browse and find a Mail Chimp-exported HTML file you want to remove the headers from.
2. Click on remove headers and save the new file
